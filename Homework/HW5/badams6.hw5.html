        <h2> Boxes are fun </h2>
        <p>Lets play with boxes. Lets add more text space to see the padding style. What should I write though? That is the question. Or not, you be the judge.</p>
        <p>Dogs are awesome. Small dogs, big dogs, hot dogs, all dogs should be treated kindly. Cats too be I do not care for them as much. Lets agree on all animals should be treated kindly.</p>
        <p>Why should boxes only be square or rectangular? Can't a box be a circle? If Amazon shipped you a package and it came in a sphere box, that is still a box even though it is circular? Only the box properties really matter, not the shape. Those are two different types of boxes, I get it.</p>
